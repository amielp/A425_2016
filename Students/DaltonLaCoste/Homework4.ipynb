Let’s estimate the galaxy merger rate in the Coma cluster to see whether it’s truly significant. The Coma cluster contains N ≈ 1000 galaxies within its half-mass radius of rh ≈ 1.5Mpc. What is the mean number density of galaxies within the half-mass radius? Suppose that the typical cross-section of a galaxy is Σ ≈ 10−3 Mpc2. How far will a galaxy in the Coma cluster travel, on average, before it collides with another galaxy? The velocity dispersion of the Coma cluster is σ ≈ 880kms−3. What is the average time between collisions for a galaxy in the Coma cluster? Is this time greater than or less than the Hubble time? ###"
