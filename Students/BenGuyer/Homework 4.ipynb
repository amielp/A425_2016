    "**A**: Previously, we derived the expression: $\\frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_e)} = 1 + z$. For this problem, $\\frac{1}{a(t_1)} = 1 + z_1$ and $\\frac{1}{a(t_2)} = 1 + z_2$. Lets define $Z$ to be the redshift of galaxy 2 as seen by galaxy 1 so $Z = \\frac{a(t_1)}{a(t_2)} - 1$. Divide the expression for $z_2$ by the equation for $z_1$ to get $\\frac{a(t_1)}{a(t_2)} = \\frac{1+z_1}{1+z_2}$. Then we can just subtract $1$ from both sides to get the expression for $Z$:\n",

    "**B**: Angular diameter distance is given by the formula $d_a = \\frac{S_k(r)}{1+z}$. The Einstein-DeSitter universe is flat, so $S_k(r) = r$. From Hubble's law (which (I hope) we can use since the redshifts are small) $v = H_0 * r$, so $r = \\frac{v}{H_0}$. Finding redshift in terms of velocity is somewhat nasty, luckily [Hyper Physics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Astro/redshf.html) has this equation: $\\frac{v}{c} = \\frac{(z+1)^2 -1}{(z+1)^2 +1}$. We can then solve for distance in terms of redshift: $r = \\frac{c}{H_0} * \\frac{(z+1)^2 -1}{(z+1)^2 +1}$. And finally angular diameter distance in terms of redshift: $d_a = \\frac{c}{H_0 (1+z)} * \\frac{(z+1)^2 -1}{(z+1)^2 +1}$.\n",

    "The angular diameter distance to galaxy 1 and 2 is then $d_a(0.5) = 1098.9$ Mpc and $d_a(1.6) = 1223.5$ Mpc. Using the equation from part a, the redshift of galaxy 2 as seen from galaxy 1 is $Z = 0.733...$. The angular diameter distance of galaxy 2 as seen from galaxy 1 is then $d_a(0.733...) = 1237.6$ Mpc."

    "**C**: It seems weird that the angular diameter distance of 2 is greater from galaxy 1 than from the origin. But this is just the usual quirk of angular diameter distances -- as you get past z=1.5, the distance actually becomes smaller. This is due to the universe's scale factor being much lower at the time the light was emitted."

Take the square root of both sides to get $<v> = \\sqrt{3}<\\sigma>$. So the time scale of collisions is $\\frac{14.2}{\\sqrt{3}*2.852*10^{-17}} = 2.875*10^{17} s = 9.11 Gyrs$. This is less than the Hubble time of approximately 14.4 Gyrs, which makes sense because they're supposed to have significant interactions.\n",

So it will take $\\frac{0.7}{3.889*10^{-18} } = 1.79*10^{17} s = 5.7 Gyrs$ to get here. Since our galaxies have been around for something like 13Gyr, the timescale of collisions in our group is roughly twice as long (~18Gyrs) as those in the Coma Cluster (~9Gyrs)."
