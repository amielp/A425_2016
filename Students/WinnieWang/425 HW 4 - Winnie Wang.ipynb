    "##### Problem 1: Redshift of Two Distant Galaxies\n",
    "Recall that the redshift, \"z\", can be represented in this form: $1 + z = \\frac{a(t_o)}{a(t_e)}$, or equivalent to $z = \\frac{a(t_o)}{a(t_e)} - 1$.\n",
    "##### Part A:\n",
    "In the observer's perspective, $a(t_o) = 1$, so the redshift of the first and second galaxy can be denoted as: $1 + z_1 = \\frac{1}{a(t_e,1)}$ and $1 + z_2 = \\frac{1}{a(t_e,2)}$ respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same expression, the redshift of galaxy 2 observed from galaxy 1 can be written this way: $1 + z_{2,1} = \\frac{a(t_{o,1})}{a(t_{e,2})}$, where $z_{2,1}$ is the redshift of 2 observed from 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are observing in the frame of galaxy 1, $a(t_{o,1}) = a(t_{e,1})$. Hence the redshift observed from galaxy 1 is: $1 + z_{2,1} = \\frac{a(t_{e,1})}{a(t_{e,2})}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Replacing $a(t_{e,1})$ and $a(t_{e,2})$ with the first expressions result in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 + z_{2,1} = \\frac{a(t_{e,1})}{a(t_{e,2})} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + z_1}}{\\frac{1}{1 + z_2}} = \\frac{1 + z_2}{1 + z_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging this above expression shows that the redshift of galaxy 2 observed from galaxy 1 shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{2,1} = \\frac{1 + z_2}{1 + z_1} - 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part B:\n",
    "To find the angular distance there are two relations that can be used. Firstly, in a flat universe, the angular and proper distance are related by: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_A = \\frac{d_p (t_o)}{(1 + z)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, the general expression relating the state parameter, $\\omega$, and proper distance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_p(t_o) = \\frac{2c}{H_o(1+3\\omega)}[1 - {(1 + z)}^{-\\frac{1 + 3\\omega}{2}}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a matter-only universe, $\\omega = 0$. Putting this in to the above expression leaves the proper distance relation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_p(t_o) = \\frac{2c}{H_o}[1 - {(1 + z)}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}] = \\frac{2c}{H_o}[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+z}}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting this expression into $d_A$, it is observed that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_A = \\frac{d_p (t_o)}{(1 + z)} \\rightarrow \\frac{2c}{H_o(1 + z)}[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + z}}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since c = speed of light = $3*10^8 m/s$ = $3*10^5 km/s$ and $H_o = 70 km/(Mpc\\bullet s)$, $\\frac{2c}{H_o}$ evaluates to ${(6*{10}^{5})}/{70}$ Mpc, or about $8571.428571$ Mpc. Putting this number in makes the angular distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_A = \\frac{d_p (t_o)}{(1 + z)} \\rightarrow \\frac{8571.428571}{(1 + z)}[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + z}}]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting $z_1 = 0.5$ and $z_2 = 1.6$, it is observed that putting these numbers into the expression solved in part A, the redshift of galaxy 2 observed from galaxy 1 shows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$z_{2,1} = \\frac{1 + 1.6}{1 + 0.5} - 1 \\approx 1.733$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the angular distances of based on $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_{2,1}$ are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{A, z_1} = \\frac{8571.428571}{(1 + 0.5)}[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 0.5}}] \\approx 1048.6\\,Mpc = 1.0486\\,Gpc$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{A, z_2} = \\frac{8571.428571}{(1 + 1.6)}[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 1.6}}] \\approx 1252.2\\,Mpc = 1.2522\\,Gpc$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d_{A, z_{2,1}} = \\frac{8571.428571}{(1 + 1.733)}[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + 1.733}}] \\approx 1239.2\\,Mpc = 1.2392\\,Gpc$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Part C:\n",
    "\n",
    "The angular distances calculated here are relatively close to about ~1 Gyr. This makes physical sense because the redshifts for these two galaxies are relatively close to each other, since the difference between $z_1$ = 0.5 and $z_2$ = 1.6 is 1.1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it is observed that the change in redshift is not linearly proportional to the change in angular distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, despite the fact that the second galaxy has a 3x larger redshift than the first galaxy, there is only a 200 $Mpc$ observed difference, but this is consistent with the expansion of the universe because the redshift is inversely proportional to the scaling factor and the angular distance."

    "##### Problem 2: (Corrected) Ryden 8.5 with N = 1000 galaxies in the half- mass sphere, and $r_h = 1.5\\,Mpc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Mean number density of galaxies within the half-mass radius?\n",
    "The density of galaxies, \"n\", in a given volume is the total number of galaxies contained per volume. To put this in variables, this is equivalent to: $n  = \\frac{N}{V_{sphere}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the volume of sphere is: $V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi {r}^{3}$, or specifically $V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi {r_h}^{3}$ for a sphere with the half-mass radius. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, a sphere with a half-mass radius has a volume of: $V_{sphere} = \\frac{4}{3} (3.1415) {1.5\\,Mpc}^{3} \\approx 14.137\\,{Mpc}^{3}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence the mean number of density of galaxies that are within this sphere of a half-mass radius is:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Mean collision distance?\n",
    "For a galaxy to collide with another galaxy, the mean free path of the galaxy must be calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we want that the product of the cross section area, $\\sigma_{galaxy} = {10}^{-3}\\,Mpc$, travel path, $d_{path}$, and the number of galaxies to be 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_{galaxy} d_{path} n_{galaxy} = 1\\,galaxy$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In solving for the mean free path, rearranging this expression results:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{path} = \\frac{1\\,galaxy}{n_{galaxy} \\sigma_{galaxy}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Plugging the known numbers from the first part results to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ d_{path} = \\frac{1\\,galaxy}{70.737\\frac{galaxies}{{Mpc}^{3}}{{10}^{-3}{Mpc}^{2}}} \\approx 14.137\\,Mpc$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Average collision time? Greater/smaller than Hubble time?\n",
    "From the general relationship between distance, velocity and time, or in particular, $d = vt$, it is determined that the average time for collision is obtained from dividing the average distance by the average velocity, or equivalently, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$<t> = \\frac{<d>}{<v>}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we do not know any galaxy's average velocity in the cluster, the relationship between the average velocity squared and velocity dispersion can be used. The relationship specifically shows that: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ <{v}^{2}> = 3{\\sigma}^{2} \\rightarrow <v> = \\sqrt{3{\\sigma}^{2}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the velocity dispersion in the Coma cluster is $\\sigma \\approx 880 km*{s}^{-1}$, and that the mean collision distance, $<d> \\approx 14.137\\,Mpc$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ <t> = \\frac{<d>}{<v>} = \\frac{<d>}{<\\sqrt{3{\\sigma}^{2}}>}\\,\\approx\\,\\frac{14.137\\,Mpc}{\\sqrt{3}*880\\frac{km}{s}} = \\frac{4.362*{10}^{20}\\,km}{1524.2047...\\frac{km}{s}} \\approx 2.86*{10}^{17}\\,s \\approx 9.07\\,Gyr$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This number is not larger than the Hubble time, which is roughly 14.4 $Gyr$, so it should be expected galaxies in the Coma cluster had collided, if the Coma cluster is older than 9.07 $Gyr$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Compare with collision time of Andromeda and Milky Way to galaxies in Coma cluster?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are observing the collision of Andromeda in our own galaxy, we are observing in a frame that is not moving. Given that we know the average velocity of travel, it can be estimated that the mean collision time between our galaxy and Andromeda is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ <t>\\,= \\frac{<d>}{<v>} = \\frac{700kpc}{120\\frac{km}{s}} = \\frac{2.16*{10}^{19}km}{120\\frac{km}{s}} = 1.8*{10}^{17}\\,seconds \\approx 5.708\\,Gyr$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This number is much smaller than the average galaxy collision time in the Coma cluster (~9.07 Gyr), so in Hubble time, it can be inferred that either more galaxy collisions had occurred in our own cluster, or the galaxies in our cluster are smaller than those observed in the Coma cluster."
