These distances are all very close to each other, around 1000 Mpc, which makes sense because we are looking at reasonably similar redshifts. However, the redshift of galaxy 2 is over three times the redshift of galaxy 1 and yet it appears only 200 Mpc farther, which is consistent with the growing expansion rate in the universe. Also, looking at the angular diameter distance plot below we can see that in a matter-only universe, angular diameter distance is fairly constant after a certain redshift.\n",
